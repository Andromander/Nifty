    "1.2": "• Whoops, that was not Vanilla, that looks more like Twilight Forest compatibility.\n     • Ironwood Fences, Stairs, and Slabs. For those who want more than wood, but less than iron.\n     • Fiery Fences, Stairs, and Slabs. It's perfect for heating your home during Winter!\n     • Steeleaf Fences, Slabs, and Stairs. It's the natural alternative for fine steel!\n     • Arctic Fur Fences, Slabs, and Stairs. The soft and cushiony blocks are perfect for those who are a little faithful to the leap.\n    • Carminite Fences, Slabs, and Stairs. Whatever it is, how well does it bode as something durable?\n    • As a note, these blocks will persist without Twilight Forest installed. This is perfectly normal behaviour.\n • Silly me, that wasn't the right thing to put into the Mod Info. The players are aware that this version is for 1.12.2, but what about the mod itself?\n • Maybe I should let players know what to expect in updates to this mod?",
    "1.3": "Here, have an early Christmas present.\n • Added Coal Stairs, Slabs, and Fences. Only for the naughtiest builders, but viable Furnace fuel.\n • Added Redstone Stairs, Slabs, and Fences. Each with their own emission rates, I want to see some clever Redstone builds.\n • Added ■■■■■■■■■ Stairs, Slabs, and Fences. Wait, what's happening?\n • Couple more behind the scenes changes that nobody should really care about.",
    "1.4": "New year, new stuff for Nifty.\n • Added Nifty Fence Gates and gave them to each material. Now you have a compliment for that farm with Nifty Fencing.\n • Added Nifty Trapdoors and gave them to each material. Some of them won't budge without encouragement, others will slip right open, like traps.\n • Fixed Ironwood Nifty Blocks being usable as Furnace fuel, because apparently anything wooden is fuel in Minecraft.\n • For various reasons, I have removed any Twilight Forest Textures that weren't the two 'safe' textures. You'll now get Missing Nifty Textures when Twilight Forest isn't installed.\n • Not that anyone should care, but I made tidier code."

  "1.13.2": {
    "2.0": "Nifty is now out for 1.13.2! Currently, this is just a port of Nifty from 1.12.2, so nothing new has been added. Support for ConnectedTexturesMod and Twilight Forest have been removed as they are not on this version as of publishing. THIS IS NOT A RIFT MOD, PLEASE USE FORGE.",
    "2.1": "• Added Clay Stairs, Slabs, Fences, Trapdoors, and Fence Gates. Nifty was feeling out of balance, so this should fix it up.\n • Removed some leftover console prints. Those were from creating a new project and served no purpose.\n • Guess what? More things I did in the background that nobody should really care about."
