    "1.2": "• Whoops, that was not Vanilla, that looks more like Twilight Forest compatibility.\n     • Ironwood Fences, Stairs, and Slabs. For those who want more than wood, but less than iron.\n     • Fiery Fences, Stairs, and Slabs. It's perfect for heating your home during Winter!\n     • Steeleaf Fences, Slabs, and Stairs. It's the natural alternative for fine steel!\n     • Arctic Fur Fences, Slabs, and Stairs. The soft and cushiony blocks are perfect for those who are a little faithful to the leap.\n    • Carminite Fences, Slabs, and Stairs. Whatever it is, how well does it bode as something durable?\n    • As a note, these blocks will persist without Twilight Forest installed. This is perfectly normal behaviour.\n • Silly me, that wasn't the right thing to put into the Mod Info. The players are aware that this version is for 1.12.2, but what about the mod itself?\n • Maybe I should let players know what to expect in updates to this mod?",
    "1.3": "Here, have an early Christmas present.\n • Added Coal Stairs, Slabs, and Fences. Only for the naughtiest builders, but viable Furnace fuel.\n • Added Redstone Stairs, Slabs, and Fences. Each with their own emission rates, I want to see some clever Redstone builds.\n • Added ■■■■■■■■■ Stairs, Slabs, and Fences. Wait, what's happening?\n • Couple more behind the scenes changes that nobody should really care about."
